2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
SYNTH-9#1 Warning
Small multiplier  
Detected multiplier at display_inst/seg_OBUF[6]_inst_i_16 of size 16x4, it is implemented as LUTs due to its small size. To force the multiplier onto a DSP block, use the USE_DSP48 attribute.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-9#2 Warning
Small multiplier  
Detected multiplier at display_inst/seg_OBUF[6]_inst_i_21 of size 16x4, it is implemented as LUTs due to its small size. To force the multiplier onto a DSP block, use the USE_DSP48 attribute.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-9#3 Warning
Small multiplier  
Detected multiplier at display_inst/seg_OBUF[6]_inst_i_27 of size 16x4, it is implemented as LUTs due to its small size. To force the multiplier onto a DSP block, use the USE_DSP48 attribute.
